EPISIM heavily depends on external libraries, some of which are included within this repository.
Bundling these sources is often due to some library modifications or due to the fact that the version required is not provided by distributions by default.

Please note, these libraries are published under their own licensing conditions. The BSD license of EPISIM does not apply. Licensing conditions are detailed in the respective folders of the 3rd party libraries.
